Problem
Using AWS and Syncing Files: Create a workflow that uses
the AWS CLI to synchronize files between your local machine and
an S3 bucket. You can use the aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials 
action to configure your AWS credentials, and the run command to execute the aws s3 sync command.



name: Sync with S3

  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
